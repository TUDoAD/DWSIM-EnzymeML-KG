Hi @ARa2of thank you for the feedback! Maybe disabling the UMR functionality could help here? For that you can go to Preferences > Python interpreter > User Module Reloades (UMR) and uncheck the Enable UMR checkbox or add pythonnet to the exclusion list (Set UMR excluded (not reloaded) modules). Also, is there an example script that you could share with us to reproduce this locally?
