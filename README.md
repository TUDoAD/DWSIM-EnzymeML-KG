# DWSIM-EnzymeML-KG

This repository contains the code and the MS Excel files (subdirectory [ELNs](https://github.com/TUDoAD/DWSIM-EnzymeML-KG/tree/main/ELNs)) used as data input for the automated generation of process simulations in [DWSIM](https://dwsim.org).
To obtain the process simulation, the ontology [./ontologies/BaseOntology.owl](https://github.com/TUDoAD/DWSIM-EnzymeML-KG/blob/main/ontologies/BaseOntology.owl) is loaded and extended by the data contained in both Excel-files by the code contained in [ELNs_to_KG_modules.py](https://github.com/TUDoAD/DWSIM-EnzymeML-KG/blob/main/ELNs_to_KG_modules.py).
This yields a knowledge graph ([./ontologies/KG-DWSIM_EnzML_ELN.owl](https://github.com/TUDoAD/DWSIM-EnzymeML-KG/blob/main/ontologies/KG-DWSIM_EnzML_ELN.owl)) that is loaded by the code (DWSIM_modules.py)[https://github.com/TUDoAD/DWSIM-EnzymeML-KG/blob/main/DWSIM_modules.py] and used to generate the DWSIM-file, stored in the subdirectory (DWSIM)[https://github.com/TUDoAD/DWSIM-EnzymeML-KG/tree/main/DWSIM].
